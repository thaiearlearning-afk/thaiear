/* ============================================================
   sw.js — ThaiEar service worker (offline app shell + pages).
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Makes the site (and the Capacitor app, which loads the live site)
   work offline: the HTML pages, shared JS, images and fonts are cached
   on the device, so the app can cold-start with no internet, browse the
   topic grid, and open any page that's been visited while online.

   AUDIO is deliberately NOT handled here: clips live on the separate
   origin audio.thaiear.com (out of this SW's scope) and the native app's
   download feature owns offline audio. /api/ is never cached (auth,
   audio-signing, checkout must always be live).

   Strategy: same-origin GETs are NETWORK-FIRST (online always gets fresh
   content — the tandem-update model is preserved — and the cache is only
   used as the offline fallback). Fonts are now self-hosted (same-origin
   /fonts/*.woff2), so they ride the same network-first path and are also
   precached; the esm.sh Supabase bundle is cached cross-origin.
   Bump VERSION to invalidate old caches on deploy.
   ============================================================ */

   The Supabase ESM bundle used to live in the version-keyed CACHE, so EVERY deploy destroyed it —
   and it is only ever RUNTIME-cached, so nothing put it back until the user next opened the site
   ONLINE. In that window auth.js's `import(SUPABASE_ESM)` could not resolve offline, so the client
   was never created, getUser() stayed null, and every signed-in offline surface fell back to its
   logged-out state: the playlists panel showed "Sign in (via the Menu)…" instead of the playlists
   sitting in localStorage a few lines away. Reported 2026-08-09 as "I see none of my playlists"
   in airplane mode, immediately after two deploys.
   This is the same trap the PRECACHE comment below already warns about for the shell pages —
   "anything only ever runtime-cached vanishes on every deploy" — with the one asset that offline
   AUTH depends on left on the wrong side of it.
   A separate cache, not a PRECACHE entry, because the @2 entry point pulls further chunks from
   esm.sh at import time; a bucket that survives keeps the whole module graph without this file
   needing to know esm.sh's internal layout. */

   install() fires one c.add() per PRECACHE entry and swallows every failure, and skipWaiting()
   activates the new worker whether or not they landed. activate() then DELETES the previous
   version's cache — which still held all of them. So one flaky install left permanent holes, and
   the device came out of the deploy WORSE offline than it went in, with nothing ever retrying.
   Reported 2026-08-09 after five VERSION bumps in a day: the Read hub rendered as unstyled plain
   text (read.css missing), lessons fell through to the offline page (read-*.html missing), and
   meditator.png had vanished from the playlists panel — all of them precache entries.
   Two-stage repair, in this order, because the first stage needs NO network and therefore works
   even when the new worker is picked up offline:
     1. fill any gap from the OUTGOING cache before deleting it — a deploy can then never lose
        content the device already had;
     2. re-fetch just those gaps once the old caches are gone, so a migrated (possibly stale) copy
        is replaced by the current one whenever there IS a connection.
   Only ever fills gaps — an entry the install DID land is never overwritten by an older copy. */
